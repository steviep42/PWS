# PWS
This project allows a user of R to search for Personal Weather Stations within a given radius
of a location (specified either a city, state or lat/lon pair). The user gets back an object that
has a dataframe showing the weather stations in the area along with key pieces of information such
as the temperature, wind speed, etc. Note that a user can specify two different locations
so as to compare the climate in two different locales. There are a number of functions that summarize
he resulting weather object. See the included .PDF file in the man directory for more information.
